A deep learning framework that unifies ground and excited state property prediction by targeting the many-body Green's function (MBGF) and self-energy. I design and implement a graph neural network called MBGF-Net that learns the underlying physics to derive properties with competitive accuracy, unprecedented data efficiency, and impressive transferability and generalizability.
